"""vLLM reasoning parser for Apertus models.

Apertus wraps its inner reasoning ("Deliberation") between a start/end pair of
special tokens. Which *string* those tokens carry depends on the tokenizer
build, but the model always emits the same low special-token **ids**:

    id 32 = reasoning start,  id 33 = reasoning end

The apertus-omni-tokenizer repo canonicalises these as
``<|inner_prefix|>``/``<|inner_suffix|>`` (ids 32/33); some deployed builds
additionally register ``<think>``/``</think>`` at ids 32/33 (with the
``<|inner_*|>`` strings pushed to other ids). ``BaseThinkingReasoningParser``
resolves the token id from the *string* via ``vocab.get(token)``, so this parser
picks whichever candidate pair the loaded tokenizer actually exposes at the
lower (emitted) id -- working across both tokenizer schemes without edits.

Both serving modes are covered:
  * non-streaming -> ``extract_reasoning`` (overridden below)
  * streaming     -> ``extract_reasoning_streaming`` (inherited; keys on the
    generated start/end token ids, so it is unaffected by ``skip_special_tokens``)

The non-streaming override is the important bit: when the model emits NO inner
tokens at all -- a direct tool call (``<|tools_prefix|>...``) or a plain answer
with no deliberation -- the whole output is returned as ``content`` (not
reasoning), so the tool-call parser still sees it and direct answers are not
swallowed. The non-streaming string split needs the delimiters to survive
detokenization; the tokenizer builder registers them as *non-special* so they do
under the default ``skip_special_tokens=true`` (apertus-omni-tokenizer #5, fixed
via ``mark_tokens_non_special``). Streaming keys on token ids and is unaffected
either way.
